Final Project Submission

For this final assignment, I am presenting my completed website along with its supporting documentation. This project demonstrates my ability to plan, design, build, and enhance a professional website using HTML, CSS, and AI-assisted tools, following a real-world web development workflow.

The website is fully deployed and accessible via a live link, and the complete source code is available in a public GitHub repository. The project features a responsive layout, accessible design practices, and clear structure, ensuring usability across devices and for all users.

Through this project, I applied industry-standard practices such as version control with GitHub, structured documentation, and iterative improvement. This submission reflects both technical skill and thoughtful design, delivering a fully functional product ready for client review.
